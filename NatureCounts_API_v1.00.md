# NatureCounts API Version 1.0 #

The goal of the API is to make NatureCounts data available to external client software and services.
It aims at replacing some of the R functions that were developed many years ago and require at direct ODBC connection to the database,
which is protected by a firewall.

The entrypoints described below will return a HTTP response status code 200 on success. In the event of an error the HTTP
response code will reflect this, and the response payload will be a JSON Object with 3 attributes:

- **error:** an [http response code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) matching the one in the response header
- **entryPoint:** a text representation of the entry point that generated the error
- **error_msg:** a short text explanation


## MetaData Entry Points ##

These entry points do not require authentication. Their purpose is to return descriptive information that
will be helpful in querying collection data, or interpretting the same.

The response payload is a JSON object, whose attributes are vectors of data values, named for their column heading. 


### API Version ###

`/api_version`

Returns JSON response with attribute 'api_version', equals to the current api version (String). This same
version string is returned as part of the response to a successful authentication request.

>**Example URL:** /api/api_version


### BMDE Versions ###

`/metadata/bmde_versions`

Returns a list of the BMDE standards versions available (e.g. BMDE2.00-ext is the extensive version containing all available fields,
and BMDE-MKN-2.00 is a version designed for Monarch datasets).

## BMDE Data Exploration ##

Data access is controlled at the level of collections. Read
[a primer on data access](https://www.birdscanada.org/birdmon/default/nc_access_levels.jsp) for full details.

The (successful) data query response payload will be a JSON Object with an attribute called `results`, carrying the data vectors. The
response structure may also include other attributes, mentioned below.



#### Authentication ####

The API controls collection data access using a token that is generated when a user authenticates.
The token has a limited life span (currently 20 days), so the client application should require user authentication 
for each new session.

A user may hold multiple valid tokens at a time, allowing them to work from more than one session (or device) at once.

This entrypoint requires a login username and password, and if valid, returns a JSON object carrying
a token with a 20 day validity period, as well as the current api_version designation (String).
The client application can then present the token as user credentials in the data access entry points, where applicable.

Required parameter: **username** - the account username

Required parameter: **password** - the account password

>**Example URL:** /api/data/authenticate?username=asdfasdf&password=qwerty

>**Example Response:** {"token":"1234567890qwerty"}



### Filtering Data ###


BMDE Data requests support filtering, as described in each entry point explanation below. Filters are submitted as a JSON object
on the request, along with the token (if required); an typical request will look like this:

>**Example Data Request with filter**: /api/data/get_data?token=qwertyqwerty&filter={ ... }

Details on the filter structure are found below.


#### Basic Filtering ####

The following optional filter parameters can be submitted to most of the BMDE Data entrypoints. All must be encoded as JSON Arrays (vectors), as
shown in the example column.

| Parameter Name | Type | Explanation | Example |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **collections** | Vector of strings | Collection codes | ["ABATLAS1","ABATLAS2","BBS50"] |
| **species** | Vector of integers | Species id's | [440,2700] |
| **country** | Vector of strings | Country ISO codes | ["CA","US"] |
| **statProv** | Vector of strings | State or Province ISO codes | ["ON","AB"] |
| **bcr** | Vector of strings | Bird conservation regions numbers | ["BCR.14"] |
| **iba** | Vector of strings | IBA site codes | ["IBA.SK016","IBA.AB112","IBA.AB115"] |
| **subNat2** | Vector of strings | Subnational2 (e.g. county) codes | ["CA.ON.FR"] |


#### Advanced Filtering ####

The following filters may not apply to all entrypoints:

| Parameter Name | Type | Explanation | Example |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **siteCode** | Vector of strings | Site codes | |
| **utmSquare** | Vector of stings | 7-letter UTM atlas squares | ["17TNH42"] |
| **minLat** | Real number | Minimum latitude (decimal degrees) | 45.0000 |
| **maxLat** | Real number | Maximum latitude (decimal degrees) | 47.4567 |
| **minLong** | Real number | Minimum latitude (decimal degrees) | -87.9987 |
| **maxLong** | Real number | Minimum latitude (decimal degrees) | -87.4565 |
| **startYear** | Integer | Earliest year | 2012 |
| **endYear** | Integer | Final year | 2013 |
| **startDay** | Integer | Earliest day in year (1-366) | 300 |
| **endDay** | Integer | Final day in year (1-366) | 350 |

See the Raw data entrypoint below for additional filtering applicable to that function only.

## BMDE Data Entry Points ##

### List Permissions on Collections ###

`/data/list_permissions`

Returns a list of accessible data collections and permissions currently granted for each. If no token is supplied, the result list
will show only those collections that are Level 5 (public). If a token is provided, the list will also include 
collections to which the user has explicit access.

>Optional parameter: **token** - the session token to identify the user

>**Example URL:** /api/data/list_permissions?token=qwertyqwerty


### List Collections ###

`/data/list_collections`

Obtain a list of collection codes and some statistics about the number of records accessible,
matching the filter criteria, for one or more dataset of AKN level 2 or more.

Authentication not required.

>**Example URL:** /api/data/list_collections?filter={ ... }


### List Species ###

`/data/list_species`

Obtain a list of species IDâ€™s and some statistics about the number of records accessible, matching the search criteria,
for any dataset of AKN level 2 or more.

Authentication not required.

>**Example URL:** /api/data/list_species?filter={ ... }


### Get Raw Data ###

`/data/get_data`

Obtain raw data for a given collection. This query requires a single collection be specified as the `collection` attribute in the filter parameter, and the collection
must be either public, or accessible via the user's token (see the `list_permissions` entry point above).

The specific filter attributes for this call:
 
| Parameter Name | Type | Explanation | Example |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **collection** | String | A single collection code | "ABATLAS1" |
| **fields** | Vector of strings | Field names, if a subset of the standard fields is desired | ["ScientificName","InstitutionCode"] |
| **bmdeVersion** | String | **Not supported yet** | "BMDE2.00" |
| **ncFields** | Boolean | **Not supported yet** | true |


Authentication not required.

>Required filter attribute: **collection** - a specific collection code

>Optional parameter: **token** - required when accessing non-public collections

>Optional parameter: **lastRecord** - the highest `record_id` that the client received, defaulting to -1

>Optional parameter: **numRecords** - the number of records to return, subject to an upper limit

>Optional parameter: **requestId** - a request Id as a substitute for a filter structure (see below)

>**Example URL:** /api/data/raw_data?token=asdfasdf&filter={ ... }&lastRecord=0&numRecords=1000

The response payload will carry at least the `results` attribute.

The client application must treat this as a paginated call and expect to repeat the query multiple times, with updated `lastRecord` values on each subsequent request.
The client **must** expect more data if the result set was not empty and either:

1. The number of records in the result set was equal to the query value of `numRecords` (if used);
2. Or the response payload included a `requestId` attribute (see below);
 
In either of these cases, the client should expect another page of data, and should submit another request, with an updated `lastRecord` parameter.

Note that subsequent requests can use the `requestId` parameter as a substitute for the `filter` parameter. While not obligatory, this
strategy is recommended for efficiency. An example query of this type would look like this:

>**Example URL:** /api/data/raw_data?token=asdfasdf&requestId=1g2h3j4k5l6&lastRecord=13456&numRecords=1000

Once a result set has been returned that is empty or smaller than the `numRecords` requested, the `requestId` will become invalid, since
this event signals that there are no more pages of data associated with the original filter set.
