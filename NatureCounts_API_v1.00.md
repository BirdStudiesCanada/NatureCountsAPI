# NatureCounts API Version 1.0 #

The goal of the API is to make NatureCounts data available to external client software and services.
It aims at replacing some of the R functions that were developed many years ago and require at direct ODBC connection to the database,
which is protected by a firewall.

The entrypoints described below will return a HTTP response status code 200 on success. In the event of an error the HTTP
response code will reflect this, and the response payload will be a JSON Object with 3 attributes:

- **error:** an [http response code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) matching the one in the response header
- **entryPoint:** a text representation of the entry point that generated the error
- **error_msg:** a short text explanation


## MetaData Entry Points ##

These entry points do not require authentication. Their purpose is to return descriptive information that
will be helpful in querying collection data, or interpretting the same.

The response payload is a JSON object, whose attributes are vectors of data values, named for their column heading. 


#### BMDE Versions ####

Returns a list of the BMDE standards versions available (e.g. BMDE2.00-ext is the extensive version containing all available fields,
and BMDE-MKN-2.00 is a version designed for Monarch datasets).

## BMDE Data Exploration ##

Data access is controlled at the level of collections. Read
[a primer on data access](https://www.birdscanada.org/birdmon/default/nc_access_levels.jsp) for full details.

The data query response payload will be a JSON Object with a single sub-object called 'results', carrying the data vectors. The
response structure may also include other attributes, mentioned below.



#### Authentication ####

The API controls collection data access using a token that is generated when a user authenticates.
The token has a limited life span (currently 20 days), so the client application should require user authentication 
for each new session.

A user may hold multiple valid tokens at a time, allowing them to work from more than one session (or device) at once.

This entrypoint requires a login username and password, and if valid, returns a JSON object carrying
a token with a 20 day validity period. The client application can then present this
token as user credentials in the data access entry points, where required / desired.

Required parameter: **username** - the account username

Required parameter: **password** - the account password

>**Example URL:** /api/data/authenticate?username=asdfasdf&password=qwerty

>**Example Response:** {"token":"1234567890qwerty"}



## Filtering Data ##


BMDE Data requests support filtering, as described in each entry point explanation below. Filters are submitted as a JSON object
on the request, along with the token (if required); an example is shown:

>**Example Data Request with filter**: /api/data/get_data?token=qwertyqwerty&filter={ }

Details on the filter structure are found below.

In addition, the responses to raw data requests are paginated: the client application must support this as described below.

Filters are divided into two categories: Basic and Advanced.



### Basic Filtering ###

The following optional filter parameters can be submitted to most of the BMDE Data entrypoints. All must be encoded as JSON Arrays (vectors), as
shown in the example column.

| Parameter Name | Type | Explanation | Example |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **collection** | Vector of strings | Collection codes | ["ABATLAS1","ABATLAS2","BBS50"] |
| **species** | Vector of integers | Species id's | [440,2700] |
| **country** | Vector of strings | Country ISO codes | ["CA","US"] |
| **statProv** | Vector of strings | State or Province ISO codes | ["ON","AB"] |
| **bcr** | Vector of strings | Bird conservation regions numbers | ["BCR.14"] |
| **iba** | Vector of strings | IBA site codes | ["IBA.SK016","IBA.AB112","IBA.AB115"] |
| **subNat2** | Vector of strings | Subnational2 (e.g. county) codes | ["CA.ON.FR"] |


### Advanced Filtering ###

The following filters may not apply to all entrypoints:

| Parameter Name | Type | Explanation | Example |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **siteCode** | Vector of strings | Site codes | |
| **utmSquare** | Vector of stings | 7-letter UTM atlas squares | ["17TNH42"] |
| **minLat** | Real number | Minimum latitude (decimal degrees) | 45.0000 |
| **maxLat** | Real number | Maximum latitude (decimal degrees) | 47.4567 |
| **minLong** | Real number | Minimum latitude (decimal degrees) | -87.9987 |
| **maxLong** | Real number | Minimum latitude (decimal degrees) | -87.4565 |
| **startYear** | Integer | Earliest year | 2012 |
| **endYear** | Integer | Final year | 2013 |
| **startDay** | Integer | Earliest day in year (1-366) | 300 |
| **endDay** | Integer | Final day in year (1-366) | 350 |

See the Raw data entrypoint below for additional filtering applicable to that function only.

### BMDE Data Entry Points ###

### List Permissions on Collections ###

Returns a list of accessible data collections and permissions currently granted for each. The collection list will include public collections
as well as those to which the user has explicit access.

>Required parameter: **token** - the session token to identify the user

>**Example URL:** /api/data/list_permissions?token=qwertyqwerty


### List Collections ###

Obtain a list of collection codes and some statistics about the number of records accessible,
matching the filter criteria, for one or more dataset of AKN level 2 or more.

Authentication not required.

>**Example URL:** /api/data/list_collections?filter={ ... }


### List Species ###

Obtain a list of species IDâ€™s and some statistics about the number of records accessible, matching the search criteria,
for any dataset of AKN level 2 or more.

Authentication not required.

>**Example URL:** /api/data/list_species?filter={ ... }


### Get Raw Data ###

Obtain data for a given collection, which must be either public, or accessible via the user's token.
The client application must treat this as a paginated call: the response will be limited to a pre-determined number of records as defined by parameters (below).
It should repeat the query as many times as necessary, using a new 'StartRecord' number on each subsequent 
query, until The response payload 'results' object is empty or - if 'numRecords' is in use - contains less than the 'numRecords' parameter.

The response will also include an attribute 'requestId' that can be used as a substitute for a filter JSON structure, once it has been submitted. This allows
the client to submit the filter parameter only on the initial call, then to submit only the 'requestId' parameter as an index into the details
of the query. Examples can be found below.

Authentication not required.

>Required filter parameter: **collection** - a specific collection code

>Optional parameter: **token** - required when accessing non-public collections

>Optional parameter: **startRecord** - a starting record_id, defaulting to 0

>Optional parameter: **numRecords** - the number of records to return, subject to an upper limit

>Optional parameter: **requestId** - a request Id as a substitute for a filter structure (see above)

There are additional filter parameters for this call:
 
| Parameter Name | Type | Explanation | Example |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **collection** | String | A single collection codes | "ABATLAS1" |
| **fields** | Vector of strings | Field names, if a subset of the standard fields is desired | ["record_id","InstitutionCode"] |
| **bmdeVersion** | String | ???? | "BMDE2.00" |
| **ncFields** | Boolean | whether the non-BMDE fields are included in the response | true |


>**Example URL:** /api/data/raw_data?token=asdfasdf&filter={ ... }&startRecord=0&numRecords=1000

The response payload can be used to determine the next startRecord value (one more than the highest record_id returned). The requestId can also be used 
to submit more abbreviated queries as paging continues:

>**Example URL:** /api/data/raw_data?token=asdfasdf&requestId=1g2h3j4k5l6&startRecord=13456&numRecords=1000
